<h1>The 2nd Annual Reclaim Your Domain Hackathon</h1>

<h2>July 19th and 20th, 2014 Pepperdine West LA Campus</h2>

<p>A group of committed educators and programmers will be convening in Los Angeles for a hackathon to extend and develop the ideas around "Reclaim Your Domain". http://reclaimyourdomain.org/  Specific focus will be on hacking an infrastructure for syndicating, securing and managing third-part service data, as well as working together to clearly articulate the rationale and vision for this work.</p>

<p>These efforts build on an array of ongoing initiatives, as well as last year's hackathon at MIT: http://open.media.mit.edu/hackathon/</p>  

<p>The event will bring together people who have made impressive progress in these areas, though there is still a great deal of thinking, sharing, and creating to be done.</p>
