<h2>The 2nd Annual Reclaim Your Domain Hackathon</h2>

<h3>July 19th and 20th, 2014 Pepperdine West LA Campus</h3>

<p>A group of committed educators and programmers will be convening in Los Angeles for a hackathon to extend and develop the ideas around "<a href="http://reclaimyourdomain.org/">Reclaim Your Domain</a>". Specific focus will be on hacking an infrastructure for syndicating, securing and managing third-part service data, as well as working together to clearly articulate the rationale and vision for this work.</p>

<p>These efforts build on an array of ongoing initiatives, as well as <a href="http://open.media.mit.edu/hackathon/">last year's hackathon at MIT</a>, where <a href="http://reclaimyourdomain.org/">Reclaim Your Domain</a> was conceived.</p>  

<p>The event will bring together people who have made impressive progress in these areas, though there is still a great deal of thinking, sharing, and creating to be done.</p>
